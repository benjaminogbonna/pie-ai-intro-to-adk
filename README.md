# Pie & AI: Abuja - Introduction to Agent Development Kit

## This is a beginner-friendly introduction to Googleâ€™s Agent Development Kit (ADK) - a powerful framework for creating autonomous, task-completing AI agents. In this hands-on session, we walked through the core components of ADK, explored real-world use cases, and wrote code together to build a functional AI agent. Whether you're new to agent frameworks or looking to deepen your skills, this workshop will give you a strong foundation in developing next-generation AI systems with ADK.

## Required Agent Structure

For ADK to discover and run your agents properly (especially with `adk web`), your project must follow a specific structure:

```
parent_folder/
    agent_folder/         # This is your agent's package directory
        __init__.py       # Must import agent.py
        agent.py          # Must define root_agent
        .env              # Environment variables
```

### Essential Components:

1. **`__init__.py`**
   - Must import the agent module: `from . import agent`
   - This makes your agent discoverable by ADK

2. **`agent.py`**
   - Must define a variable named `root_agent`
   - This is the entry point that ADK uses to find your agent

3. **Command Location**
   - Always run `adk` commands from the parent directory, not from inside the agent directory
   - Example: Run `adk web` from the parent folder that contains your agent folder

This structure ensures that ADK can automatically discover and load your agent when running commands like `adk web` or `adk run`.

## Key Components

### 1. Identity (`name` and `description`)
- **name** (Required): A unique string identifier for your agent
- **description** (Optional, but recommended): A concise summary of the agent's capabilities. Used for other agents to determine if they should route a task to this agent.

### 2. Model (`model`)
- Specifies which LLM powers the agent (e.g., "gemini-2.0-flash")
- Affects the agent's capabilities, cost, and performance

### 3. Instructions (`instruction`)
The most critical parameter for shaping your agent's behavior. It defines:
- Core task or goal
- Personality or persona
- Behavioral constraints
- How to use available tools
- Desired output format

### 4. Tools (`tools`)
Optional capabilities beyond the LLM's built-in knowledge, allowing the agent to:
- Interact with external systems
- Perform calculations
- Fetch real-time data
- Execute specific actions

## Getting Started

This examples uses the same virtual environment created in the root directory. Make sure you have:

1. Activate the virtual environment from the root directory:
```bash
# macOS/Linux:
source ../.venv/bin/activate
# Windows CMD:
..\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Windows PowerShell:
..\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

2. Set up your API key:
   - Rename `.env_example` to `.env` in the agent folders
   - Add your Google API key to the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` variable in the `.env` file

## Running the Example

To run this basic agent example, you'll use the ADK CLI tool which provides several ways to interact with your agent:

1. Navigate to the any directory containing your agent folder.
2. Start the interactive web UI:
```bash
adk web
```

3. Access the web UI by opening the URL shown in your terminal

4. Select your agent from the dropdown menu in the top-left corner of the UI

5. Start chatting with your agent in the textbox at the bottom of the screen

### Troubleshooting

If your agent doesn't appear in the dropdown menu:
- Make sure you're running `adk web` from the parent directory, not from inside the agent directory
- Check that your `__init__.py` properly imports the agent module
- Verify that `agent.py` defines a variable named `root_agent`

### Alternative Run Methods

The ADK CLI tool provides several options:

- **`adk web`**: Launches an interactive web UI for testing your agent with a chat interface
- **`adk run [agent_name]`**: Runs your agent directly in the terminal
- **`adk api_server`**: Starts a FastAPI server to test API requests to your agent

You can exit the conversation or stop the server by pressing `Ctrl+C` in your terminal.

This examples demonstrates simple agents that responds to user requests/queries, showing the fundamentals of agent creation with ADK.
